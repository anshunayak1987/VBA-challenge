I have created three sub routines :
1.	MultiYearStock() – This sub routine creates the summary including the bonus summary.
2.	Reset() -   This sub routine clears the summary created by “MultiYearStock()” sub routine.
3.	WorksheetLoop() – This sub routine has the exactly same functionality as “MultiYearStock()” but it loops through all  the  sheets.
